# FragmentPractice
1-06-23


Summary:
The given project is an Android application that demonstrates the usage of fragments and activities. It consists of a main activity (MainActivity) that hosts several buttons representing different activities. Each button click starts a corresponding activity (ActivityOne, ActivityTwo, ActivityThree) and passes a specific data string to it. The activities display the passed data in their respective layouts.

The main activity also includes a fragment container (fragment_container) where a common fragment (MyFragment) is initially loaded. The fragment receives the data passed from the activities and displays it in its layout.

What I Learned:

Implementing click listeners for buttons in Android using setOnClickListener().
Starting activities using explicit intents and passing data between activities using intent extras.
Utilizing fragments in Android applications to display dynamic UI components.
Creating and configuring fragments programmatically.
Communicating data between activities and fragments using bundles and arguments.
Replacing fragments within a fragment container using fragment transactions.
By working on this project, you gained hands-on experience in implementing fragment-based UIs and managing activities in an Android application.
